# This PC

I do a lot of modifications on Windows, so I frequently visit this and that folder. Doing these visits manually is tedious. One has to remember the locations, toggle hidden items, etc. I rather not deal with this all the time. That's why I created a small tool that maps these commonly visited locations.

I'll also be adding some other stuff to this tool.

## Locations

Some significant locations on Windows.

List items can be edited using the `locations.txt` file.

Double clicking on an item opens the location in the Explorer.

## Summary

An overview info of the device/system.

List items can be edited using the `summary.txt` file.

Grouping is optional and arbitrary.
