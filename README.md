# This PC

I do a lot of modifications in Windows, so I frequently visit this and that folder. Doing these visits manually is tedious. That's why I thought about creating a small tool that maps these commonly visited locations.

I'll also be adding some other stuff to this tool.

## Locations

Locations can be edited using the `locations.txt` file.

Double clicking on an item in the list opens the location in the Explorer.

## Summary

An overview info of the device/system.

Items can be edited using the `summary.txt` file.
